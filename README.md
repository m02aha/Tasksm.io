# Tasksm.io: a multi-page dashboard


###### live demo | [demo](https://m02aha.github.io/Tasksm.io/)


## About this project 

A responsive design of a 4-page productivity dashboard website for developers <br>
a main page showing tasks and progress, a files page, a projects page, and a settings page. 
## built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- java script 


## What I learned :grinning:

During this project, I revised various important CSS features such as grid, flex, and responsive design .
I also wrote my self-written framework file  for this project to minimize lines in style sheets,
which was beneficial.
